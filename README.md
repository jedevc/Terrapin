# Terrapin

Terrapin is a programming environment for javascript that allows you to use a
programmable turtle to create pretty patterns.

Many other languages have turtles built into them (like in python) which can
help newcomers learn more about programming. However, javascript has no such
functionality, so I've created a simple to use program allowing anyone to make
turtle patterns directly in their browser.
